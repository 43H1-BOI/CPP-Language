    typedef is used  to define your own identifiers
    that can be used in place of type specifiers such
    as int , float , and double , etc.

    We must use "_t" or "_type" as suffix for the typedef variables
    Example :-
        typedef std::string str_t;

    syntax :-
        typedef <current_name> <new_name>;

    We can also use "*using*" keyword for aliasing of DataTypes

    syntax :-
        using <new_name> = <current_name>;
    */
