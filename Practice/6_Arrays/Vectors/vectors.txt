Vectors 
    :- Dynamic Array 
    	   Resizable
    	   Also stored in Contigious memory
	   
    Include header file <vector>

    Declaration -
	    vector <datatype> vector_name;
	    vector <datatype> vector_name(size);

Vector Methods :-
1. size() - To get Size of Vector
2. resize(new_size) - To Resize Vector
3. capacity() - It is the capacity of vector ( Doesn't Restrict to resize it for a bigger value but is defined for storage ) 
    [ capacity => size ]
    It is always increased in powers of 2. (Upper Closest Power to Size)
    Capacity is compiler dependent and it is not necessary that it will be increased if we resize our vector to any other level
4. pushback(element) - to add element at the end of the vector
5. insert(position,element) - to insert element at given position and push other elements backward
6. begin() - to get beginning position
7. end() - to get end position of a vector
8. popback() - to remove last element 
9. erase(position) - to remove element from any position 
    ( must be relative position e.g. v.begin() + 2 , v.end() - 3 , etc. ) 
10. clear() - to clear all elements from vector
